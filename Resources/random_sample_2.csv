I have used that adapter for months since getting the computer and never had a problem.   I also get that same ""slow charger"" message in Windows. However if I unplug and replug my adapter while Windows is on I stop getting that message (but the actual slow charging remains)  I have tried the various battery resets, driver resets, etc. that I have been able to find online. It seems nothing does it.  Lenovo Vantage indicates that all my drivers are up to date. * *SEE TIB*",CLOSED,CRU,0,WAR,,0,CL,3,,USLENZRZ,GMAIL.COM,0,P3,ND,POWER SUPPLY,IBM,HARDWARE SUPPORT,ERROR CODE,LENOVO,0,E,0,0,0,0,"bot_utterance: Hello Latavious, This is a Lenovo Support Virtual Agent!

I'll be your Lenovo technician today. 02:56:59 PM [00:00:20]   Kevin Blatt says: 02:57:08 PM [00:00:08]   Hello Billy Billy says: 02:57:49 PM [00:00:49]   May I have the best address for service of the PC(street,city,state,zipcode)? Kevin Blatt says: 02:59:22 PM [00:02:23]   The issue I have is that I am not at a physical address currently. Would I be able to have the battery sent to my training location and I pick it up there? Or would a technician come out to replace it? Kevin Blatt says: 03:00:24 PM [00:03:24]   I am a trainer for T-Mobile and since it is the holiday season, I am not teaching classes. I am instead conducting store visits to different stores each day in the New England area. Billy says: 03:01:20 PM [00:04:20]   The PC has an internal battery, which would need to be replaced by a technician. Kevin Blatt says: 03:02:16 PM [00:05:17]   Got it. I do start facilitating classes again on December 30th. Could I schedule a technician to come out then or after that? Kevin Blatt says: 03:02:35 PM [00:05:36]   The address is T-Mobile, 14 McGrath Hwy, Somerville MA 02143 Billy says: 03:03:09 PM [00:06:09]   Thank you, we would only be able to schedule on-site repair at most a week in advance.  Kevin Blatt says: 03:04:17 PM [00:07:17]   Can I schedule a tech to come out to one of the stores I am visiting next week? Billy says: 03:04:32 PM [00:07:33]   Sure. Kevin Blatt says: 03:04:52 PM [00:07:52]   What day would be best (day that has an opening?) Kevin Blatt says: 03:05:42 PM [00:08:42]   I am in stores everyday from today until Tuesday, but I know what stores I will be in. So the sooner would be better I guess. Billy says: 03:06:09 PM [00:09:09]   A technician should be out by next business day. The part will be delivered next business day. Once the part is delivered, you will be contacted to schedule best time for on-site repair.  Kevin Blatt says: 03:06:55 PM [00:09:56]   Oh ok, that works. So the part would here tomorrow/Thursday and then the tech could call and set up a date, time and location with me? Billy says: 03:07:08 PM [00:10:09]   Yes, correct.  Kevin Blatt says: 03:07:32 PM [00:10:32]   Perfect! Kevin Blatt says: 03:07:52 PM [00:10:53]   So do you send the part to me or the tech? Kevin Blatt says: 03:08:07 PM [00:11:07]   Sorry for so many questions Billy says: 03:08:29 PM [00:11:29]   Not a problem, the part would be received by the technician. Kevin Blatt says: 03:09:18 PM [00:12:19]   Perfect! Could you send that out and I can work with the tech to meet me at one of the store locations? Billy says: 03:11:00 PM [00:14:00]   Okay, a service case will still need to be created prior to shipping the part. Would the 14 McGrath Hwy, Somerville MA 02143 be in the general vacinity.  Kevin Blatt says: 03:11:12 PM [00:14:13]   Yes it will. Billy says: 03:11:24 PM [00:14:24]   One moment Billy says: 03:12:18 PM [00:15:19]   Your case number is 409NW73 Kevin Blatt says: 03:12:28 PM [00:15:28]   I just received email confirmation Billy says: 03:13:00 PM [00:16:01]   Please remember to close out the chat window as we have completed our session today. Thank you again for contacting Lenovo Technical Chat and have a wonderful day. Kevin Blatt says: 03:13:19 PM [00:16:19]   Excellent! Thank you for everything Billy. Have a great rest of your day!

François-René Rideau says:11:25:20 AM [00:00:47]  The Lenovo customer service has been going WAY down in the last few years. Sa'Briyah says:11:25:33 AM [00:01:00]  Hello how may I assist you today? François-René Rideau says:11:25:51 AM [00:01:18]  Uh, it's in the ticket description. François-René Rideau says:11:25:59 AM [00:01:26]  Also your site www.managedtechnicalsupportaccess.com won't let me login without changing my password. Sa'Briyah says:11:26:28 AM [00:01:56]  Ok no problem, just a few moments while I go ahead and get a case created for you François-René Rideau says:11:28:56 AM [00:04:23]  ... Sa'Briyah says:11:29:17 AM [00:04:44]  Yes I am here creating your case. Sa'Briyah says:11:29:41 AM [00:05:08]  May I have you verify the address in which the unit is located? François-René Rideau says:11:29:43 AM [00:05:11]  Thanks. I now hear the sound when you chat. François-René Rideau says:11:29:55 AM [00:05:22]  Same address: 151 Dudley St #3, Cambridge MA 02140, USA Sa'Briyah says:11:31:13 AM [00:06:41]  Thank you Would you like to be updated about your case via email, text or both? François-René Rideau says:11:31:47 AM [00:07:15]  both, please. Sa'Briyah says:11:32:07 AM [00:07:34]  IS 6175759012 A MOBILE PHONE NUMBER? François-René Rideau says:11:32:39 AM [00:08:06]  The technician said I might have to replace the board, and that I would be able to keep my SSD. François-René Rideau says:11:32:46 AM [00:08:14]  Yes it is. Sa'Briyah says:11:33:55 AM [00:09:22]  Thank You Sa'Briyah says:11:38:00 AM [00:13:27]  Does an external keyboard work? François-René Rideau says:11:38:05 AM [00:13:32]  Yes, no problem. François-René Rideau says:11:38:51 AM [00:14:18]  The Ctrl keys even work *sometimes* when I open my computer  unpredictable to me when. Then at some point they stop seemingly forever, until next time. Sa'Briyah says:11:39:12 AM [00:14:39]  Ok thank you. François-René Rideau says:11:39:20 AM [00:14:47]  They haven't worked today. François-René Rideau says:11:40:38 AM [00:16:05]  They were working immediately after the repair. But already less than an hour after the technician left, they stopped working. I had them working briefly yesterday and the day before. François-René Rideau says:11:41:05 AM [00:16:33]  All drivers are up to date. When probing the kernel, it gets no keyboard event. Sa'Briyah says:11:41:09 AM [00:16:37]  No problem I am going to have your system board replaced. François-René Rideau says:11:41:27 AM [00:16:55]  Thanks. Sa'Briyah says:11:41:38 AM [00:17:05]  My pleasure François-René Rideau says:11:41:42 AM [00:17:09]  That is very weird. I can't imagine what's going on. François-René Rideau says:11:41:47 AM [00:17:14]  Why the two Ctrl keys? François-René Rideau says:11:42:16 AM [00:17:43]  is there a magic controller on the board that is supposed to intercept the Ctrl keys to detect some magic key combinations? François-René Rideau says:11:42:31 AM [00:17:58]  (What are those combinations?) François-René Rideau says:11:43:37 AM [00:19:04]  I see that this kind of problem has happened in the past: https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/ThinkPad-T400-T500-and-newer-T/T410-both-CRTL-keys-not-working/td-p/561523 Sa'Briyah says:11:43:53 AM [00:19:21]  I honestly wouldn't be able to tell you why just those two aren't working Sa'Briyah says:11:44:29 AM [00:19:56]  409RT94 is your new case number. Sa'Briyah says:11:44:47 AM [00:20:15]  What we are going to do is Order the part, which will be shipped to the Drop point, where the technician will go and pick up the part. Once the part has been Delivered, the Technician picks up the part, and then will call you to Schedule the time of service. The Technician will attempt to contact you for 3 business days by phone and by email.  François-René Rideau says:11:46:16 AM [00:21:43]  Thanks a lot.
