Out of the blue it was stuck saying 100% for 2 days. Now it is stuck at 0% - Not charging. The battery status is 'no activity'. I have attempted a power reset with no success Simon Schwartz says:05:27:28 PM [00:02:46]  I am currently using a different laptop so I can perform any potential tasks we discuss without getting disconnected Sheila says:05:27:48 PM [00:03:07]  I'll be happy to assist you with that, May I have a good address for where the unit is located please?

Under this the only info I can find is status: no activity. if I close that, the 'power section' gives me the option to select 'power smart settings' 'battery settings' 'power settings' and 'other settings' Sheila says:05:39:34 PM [00:14:53]  what happens when you click power settings?

I'll be your Lenovo technician today.11:33:53 AM [00:00:00]  John Umstott says:11:34:42 AM [00:00:48]  Hello. I have a newly purchased m920s that is not able to see its m.2 drive. John Umstott says:11:35:06 AM [00:01:13]  I have updated the bios and it did not make any difference. John Umstott says:11:35:37 AM [00:01:44]  I am able to boot from USB media but am not able to access the m.2 drive from that either. Al says:11:36:05 AM [00:02:12]  I would be happy to Assist, May I have a good address for where the unit is located please?  John Umstott says:11:36:59 AM [00:03:06]  It is currently at 100 5th st South Minneapolis, MN but the owner is located in a different office. I am my agency's IT support. Al says:11:38:16 AM [00:04:23]  What address will the machine be serviced if needed? John Umstott says:11:39:25 AM [00:05:32]  The one I gave you would be the service address for now. Until it is in working order it will not be sent to the end user's location. Al says:11:39:41 AM [00:05:48]  Thank you, One moment while I create a case for you. Al says:11:41:23 AM [00:07:30]  Thank you so much for your Patience, your new case number is 409R8TC John Umstott says:11:42:31 AM [00:08:38]  Ok, does this mean that it requires an on site tech inspection or are there any further steps that can be taken first? Al says:11:43:21 AM [00:09:28]  Have you tried another HDD in the machine? Or have you tried testing the drive in a different machine to see if it will duplicate the same issue? John Umstott says:11:44:29 AM [00:10:36]  We do not currently have any other machines with m.2 slots for me to test with. Also I was hesitant to try and remove the m.2 sled in this machine as it looks fairly breakable. John Umstott says:11:45:16 AM [00:11:22]  Most of my people are fairly behind the times and have just recently started getting SATA SSDs, much less m.2 Al says:11:46:05 AM [00:12:12]  What we are going to do is Order the part, which will be shipped to the Drop point, where the technician will go and pick up the part. Once the part has been Delivered, the Technician picks up the part, and then will call you to Schedule the time of service. The Technician will attempt to contact you for 3 business days by phone and by email.  John Umstott says:11:46:23 AM [00:12:30]  Ok thank you Al says:11:46:38 AM [00:12:45]  My pleasure, Thank you for using Lenovo chat Support.
